raw_data_plots.py generates Figures 3 and 4 in my PDF writeup. The rest of the figures (with the exception of Figure 9) are generated by running final_project.py. On my laptop, final_project.py took around 12 minutes to run. I will also note that Figure 14 is a frame from the "k=2_isomap_theta_60.gif" gif generated by final_project.py.

Since this is a public repository, I am including only the raw data and code used to generate the plots in my project, without explaining what the data actually means (which is, of course, explained in the writeup). I consider it EXTREMELY unlikely that anyone would try to poach the research I am doing here (which is fairly esoteric and may not even pan out to anything worthwhile), but I figured it's better to be safe than sorry considering the project concerns original research which is not yet fully developed.
